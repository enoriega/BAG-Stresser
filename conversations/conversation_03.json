      "content": "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously (superposition). This allows them to solve certain complex problems much faster."

      "content": "Consumer quantum computers are likely decades away. Current quantum computers require extreme cooling and are very expensive. In the near term (5-10 years), we'll see cloud-based quantum computing services for businesses and researchers, but not personal quantum computers."
