VMs include a full OS copy, providing stronger isolation but using more resources. Containers are better for microservices; VMs for complete OS-level isolation."

It specifies the base image (FROM), copies files (COPY), runs commands (RUN), sets environment variables (ENV), exposes ports (EXPOSE), and defines the startup command (CMD). Think of it as a recipe for your container."
